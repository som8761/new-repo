<!-- While loops are indeed commonly used for conditional purposes, but it's important to clarify that they are primarily used for situations where you need to repeat a block of code based on a condition. The condition in a while loop is re-evaluated before each iteration, and the loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true. This behavior makes while loops well-suited for tasks that involve repetition until a specific condition is met. -->

so basically amra kono kichu condition diye jadi kono kaj kori tahole seta if statement diye kori,,but if statement single time kaj kore tarpor seta close hoye jai...
but while loop serokom noy,,akbar condition check korar por seta execute hoy that means iterate hoy..abar re-iterate hoy condition check kore..


** so moral of the story holo j while loop kono condition ke dakhe setake repetadely chalay,jatokhn na porjonto amader target ta archive hoche..

so jadi amader kono condition thake r seta jadi multiple times chalate hoy tahole  ami while loop use korte pari..ata condition o dabe r multiple times iterate o korbe.er kichu restrictions o thske.
